# Hi there üëã ! Welcome to Cyril Gadal's profile.

- :mag: I'm an academic researcher, specialising in fluid dynamics and granular materials.
- :earth_africa: I mostly study Earth/natural systems, such as rivers, sand dunes or avalanches.
- üßê If you want to know more, feel free to have a look at my [personal page](https://cgadal.github.io/), [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tboDIRUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or just contact me :)


I recently organised my repositories into organizations. Hence you can not find them inside my profile, but inside the organizations' pages, listed at the bottom left of this page. Most interesting organizations are probably:
- :movie_camera: [cgadal-presentations](https://github.com/orgs/cgadal-presentations/repositories)
- :newspaper: [cgadal-papers](https://github.com/orgs/cgadal-papers/repositories)
- :computer: [cgadal-pythonpackages](https://github.com/orgs/cgadal-pythonpackages/repositories)
