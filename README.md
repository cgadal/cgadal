# Hi there üëã ! Welcome to Cyril Gadal's profile.

- :mag: I'm an academic researcher, specialising in fluid dynamics and granular materials.
- :earth_africa: I mostly study Earth/natural systems, such as rivers, sand dunes or avalanches.
- üßê If you want to know more, feel free to have a look at my [personal page](https://cgadal.github.io/), [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tboDIRUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or just contact me :)


I recently organised my repositories into organisations. Hence, you cannot find them inside my profile, but rather on the organisations' pages, listed at the bottom left of this page. Most interesting organisations are probably:
- :movie_camera: [cgadal-presentations](https://github.com/cgadal-presentations)
- :newspaper: [cgadal-papers](https://github.com/orgs/cgadal-papers/repositories)
- :computer: [cgadal-packages](https://github.com/orgs/cgadal-packages/repositories)
